# Assessment Test

I got absolutely bodied by this. Scored only 8/20. Nowhere near passing. 

Looks like I got a lot of studying to do. 

I don't know if I can actually post the questions itself here but I guess I can write down what topics I got right and what topics I got wrong. 

## Right Answers 
- disassociation attacks
- hardware root of trust
- password security settings
- insider threats
- corrective control
- acceptable use policies
- data minimization techniques
- document types

## Wrong Answers
- reason for disabling automatic patches
- forensic order of volatility
- Heatmaps
- Hot sites
- Embedded System constraints
- password attacks
- sys access for h2l security zones
- deployment env usage
- policy violation
- cert domains
- public/private keys
- risk management strategy
